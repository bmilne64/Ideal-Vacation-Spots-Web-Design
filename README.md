# Ideal Vacation Spots Web Design 

https://bmilne64.github.io/Ideal-Vacation-Spots-Web-Design/

In this project, I created a website by using the visualizations that I created for the Ideal Vacation Spots Project that can be found at https://github.com/bmilne64/python-api-challenge.

The website consists of seven pages as follows:

1) A landing page that contains an explanation of the project and a link to each visualization page within a sidebar containing a preview image of each visualization. 

2) Four visualization pages each with a descriptive title, the visualization for the selected comparison and a paragraph describing the visualization and its significance.

3) A comparisons page that contains all the visualizations on the same page so that people can easily compare them which uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations. 

4) A data page that displays a responsive table containing the data that the visualizations use.
