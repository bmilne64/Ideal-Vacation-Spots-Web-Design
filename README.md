# Web-Design-Challenge

In this assignment, I created a website by using the visualizations that you created for your Python-APIs Challenge thta can be found at https://github.com/bmilne64/python-api-challenge.

The website consists of seven pages as follows:

1) A landing page that contains an explanation of the project and a link to each visualization page within a sidebar containing a preview image of each visualization. 

2) Four visualization pages each with a descriptive title, the visualization for the selected comparison and a paragraph describing the visualization and its significance.

3) A comparisons page that contains all the visualizations on the same page so that people can easily compare them which uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations. 

4) A data page that displays a responsive table containing the data that the visualizations use. 

At the top of every page, the website has a navigation bar that does the following:

1) Contains the name of the site on the left side of the navigation bar, allowing users to return to the landing page from any page.

2) Contains a drop-down menu, named Plots, on the right side of the navigation bar that contains a link to each visualization page.

3) Provides two more text links on the right side: Comparisons, which links to the comparisons page, and Data, which links to the data page.

4) Is responsive (via media queries).
